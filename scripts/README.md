# Scripts

Common helper functions to solve everyday problems.

> ℹ️ These functions are written in TypeScript. If you would like plain JavaScript, run the `npm build` command to get the equivalent. The built JavaScript will be output to the `scripts/dist` directory.

# Getting Started

In a terminal, in the `./scripts` directory run `npm install`

# Run Tests

`npm run tests`

# Build TypeScript to JavaScript

`npm run build`

The built TypeScript will be output in `./scripts/dist` directory.
