# Problem Solving Patterns

This is Section 5 of the [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/share/101X5s3@wgKELq5ISUWj2uP-X8KOnz8hcQEajJNYP12SWWlk5p6P2WnYQ_YbIWWVu8p4Co8C/).

# Frequency Counter Pattern

Used to observe frequencies among two objects, something like two arrays in which you want to compare.

# Multiple Pointers

Uses two pointers to map to an index or position, typically the start, middle, or end. This can be efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity.

# Sliding Window

This pattern involes creating a window which can be an array or number. Depending on the condition, the window will expand or shrink. This is useful for tracking a subset of an array, string, etc.

# Divide and Conquer

This pattern involes dividing a data set into smaller subsets, then repeating a process on that subset of data. This pattern can greatly reduce time complexity.

This could have a technique like Binary Search, which would be better than a linear search, with a time complexity of O(log n).
