# Singly Linked Lists

A data structure that contains a **head**, **tail**, and **length** property.

Linked Lists consist of nodes, and each **node** has a value and a **pointer** to another node or null.

They do not have indexes like arrays. Connected via nodes with a **next** pointer. Random access is not allowed.
